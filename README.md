ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dylansevans or if we're familiar, Dylan Evans

I am an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, and I have a great drive to implement my mathemmatics into whatever code I can, whether that is visualization, simulation, or optimization.

I have a great drive to make things faster by the slightest or automate tasks I find the slightest bit tedious.

This code on my page spans from Seventh Grade to Undergraduate.
