- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dylansevans

- I am an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, and I have a great drive to implement my mathemmatics into whatever code I can, whether that is visualization, simulation, or optimization.

- I have a great drive to make things faster by the slightest or automate tasks I find the slightest bit tedious.
